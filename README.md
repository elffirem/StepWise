# Step Wise

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- The backend server is running locally. You can start the backend server and ensure it is accessible at `http://10.0.2.2:8080/` or `http://localhost:8080/.
- Flutter is installed on your machine. Follow the [official Flutter installation guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) if you haven't installed it yet.
- Android Virtual Device (AVD) is set up. You can create and manage AVDs using Android Studio.

## Running the App

To run the app, follow these steps:

1. **Start the Backend Server**: Here is the instruction on how to start the backend server in this repository:
  [Backend Server](https://github.com/behzodfaiziev/stepwise-backend/blob/main/README.md)

2. **Open the Project in Android Studio**: Open the Flutter project in Android Studio.

3. **Run the AVD**: Start the Android Virtual Device (AVD) from Android Studio. Make sure only the AVD is running because a physical device will probably not have access to `localhost`.

4. **Run the Flutter App**: 

5. **Access the App**: The app should now be running on the AVD and communicating with the backend server at `http://10.0.2.2:8080/`.

## Additional Information

- If you encounter any issues, ensure that the backend server is running and accessible at the specified address.
- For more information on Flutter development, refer to the [official Flutter documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs).
